# gas-gas-gas
  A guide on bit-wise operations on unsigned numbers written on 8 bits. Everything in here can also be applied to 32-bit unsigned integers with some minor editing. This contains most if not all the things you need to know how to do with bit-wise operations, as well as some optional things for those who want to know more.
  
  The program also includes a working menu, if you need help with making one, you can follow the template.
